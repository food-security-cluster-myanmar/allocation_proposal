## Introduction 

This document outlines a proposal to calculate the Food Security Cluster PIN based on a combination of REACH MSNA data and FAO/WFP survey Round 3. 

It is currently unclear if the fourth round of results from FAO/WFP will be ready in time for the rest of the 2023 planning exercises. Though, it should also be mentioned that a cursory inspection of the various datasets shows the MSNA to be very well conducted and a more than able replacement for the FAO/WFP survey, should it not be finished in time. 

It is my intention, with these provisional results, to provide partners with information that might help shape the
It is my intention, with this mock-up, to provide partners with information on how the state and township allocations may look in 2023. 

I would also encourage any and all comments from all concerned parties.

## State and Region PINs



Using the food consumption scores from the MSNA and the reduced coping strategies index from the FAO/WFP Survey Round 3, it has been possible to replicate the CARI methodology used to calculate the 2022 PIN. 

Below is an explanatory chart where how each of the food consumption and coping strategies indicators relate to the 4 CARI domains.

```{r eval = FALSE}
nat %>% summarise_at("PIN", sum)


(16961605 - 13230378) / 16961605
```


Applying this methodology to currently available data, yields a unionwide PIN of 16,961,605. This is the total number of persons who are moderately and severely food insecure. This is a 22% increase from the 2022 PIN of 13,230,378.

## Township PINs

This section seeks to provide specific township PINs. To do this, we make use of the state/region PINs in the section above and divide up this state-level PIN across all the townships in that state. 

For reference, township-level prioritisation scores related to conflict (2022) and pre-existing vulnerability (2019) were developed in the food security cluster's paper on  [Township Prioritisation](https://food-security-cluster-myanmar.github.io/mmr_township_prioritisation/); please see there for more details. 

But in brief, the conflict score is a weighted average of the following indicators: 

* Number of IDPs
* Number of conflict fatalities
* Number of Battles
* Number of incidents of explosions and remote violence
* Number of incidents of violence against civilians
* Number of strategic developments (includes arrests)
* Number of non-peaceful protests and riots

And the multi-dimensional vulnerability score is an average of the following indicators, updated in 2019: 

* % of population without formal identification documents
* % of population without a middle school education
* % of females who were illiterate
* % of households with bamboo or thatched roofs
* % of households with safe sanitation
* % of households with access to electricity
* % of workers who are unpaid family workers
* The child dependency ratio

The caseload for each township would be either the number of persons affected by conflict or the number of persons who had pre-exisiting multi-dimensional vulnerability, depending on which figure is higher. These township caseloads were then used to determine each townships share of the state PIN. 

For instance, if township A had 20% of the caseload of the state, it should also be allocated 20% of the PIN. 

For review and validation, the remaining sections of this document break down the township-level PIN by state. It would be useful to speak to your field colleagues to see if the model developed is a fair approximation of needs. Preliminary validation has already been carried out with some food security partners to some encouraging results.

In the tables below, higher conflict scores are worse, with the highest possible conflict score being `100`.

                        "Shan (East)" = "Shan",

### Ayeyarwady 

```{r}
nat %>%
  filter(state == "Ayeyarwady") %>%
  nat_table()

```

<br><br>

### Bago

Unfortunately, this is a combination of Bago East and West since the FAO/WFP survey was considered one entity inside their survey. 

<br>

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Bago") %>% 
  nat_table()
  
```

<br><br>

### Chin 

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Chin") %>% 
  nat_table()
```


<br><br>
 
### Kachin

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Kachin") %>% 
  nat_table()
```

<br><br>

### Kayah 

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Kayah") %>% 
  nat_table()

```

<br><br>

### Kayin

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Kayin") %>% 
  nat_table()
```


<br><br>

### Magway

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Magway") %>% 
  nat_table()
```

<br><br>

### Mandalay

According to the MSNA, Mandalay had no households which were moderately or severely food insecure and consequently, has been excluded from the PIN.

<br>

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Mandalay") %>% 
  nat_table()
```


<br><br>

### Mon

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Mon") %>% 
  nat_table()
```

<br><br>

### Nay Pyi Taw

Nay Pyi Taw has no targets and was not surveyed in the FAO/WFP survey or the MSNA. It was, however, included in IFPRI. 

However, Nay Pyi Taw has no targets as it is the capital and a Tatmadaw stronghold. Additionally, the government does not appreciate humanitarian interventions targeted at Nay Pyi Taw residents. 

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Nay Pyi Taw") %>% 
  nat_table()
```


<br><br>

### Rakhine

The high conflict score in Sittwe is primarily due to the massive presence of IDPs there. However, the oeveral PIN for Sittwe is brought down by the relatively lower proportions of the township that are food insecure. 

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Rakhine") %>% 
  nat_table()
```

<br><br>

### Sagaing

Sagaing is similar to Kayin in that, in the majority of townships, the numbers of conflict-affected persons are much higher the numbers of persons with pre-existing vulnerability. 

<br>


```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Sagaing") %>% 
  nat_table()
```


<br><br>

### Shan 

Similar to Bago, the sampling of the FAO/WFP survey is insufficiently detailed to break down results acrros Shan North, Shan East and Shan South. Their townhips have all been combined into one long table below. 

<br>


```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Shan") %>% 
  nat_table()
```


<br><br>

### Tanintharyi

The high conflict score in Sittwe is primarily due to the massive presence of IDPs there. Together, Sittwe, 


```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Tanintharyi") %>% 
  nat_table()
```



<br><br>

### Yangon

The calculated PIN for Yangon in 2023 is a modest 39,705 persons. This is completely in line with the worsening and more urgent needs in other parts of the country. It is also highly-suggested that urban programming, private-sector collaboration and market interventions be used in urban areas. 

<br>

```{r}
nat %>% 
  filter(state == "Yangon") %>% 
  nat_table()

```

<br><br>

### Limitations of the township PINs

So far, the prioritisation exercise has bee fairly agnostic about conflict vs. pre-existing vulnerability, counting the higher of the two figures as the caseload for each township. Were a strategic decision to be made to change to focus only to conflict-affected areas, then these allocations should shift substantially.

nat %>% 
  write_csv("./data/draft_pin_dataset.csv")
